You will need pigpio & puredata headers, which I installed like this:

```
sudo apt install libpigpio-dev puredata-dev
```

Also check out [pdpigpio](https://github.com/nullpainter/pdpigpio), as it uses similar ideas, for GPIO/mcp3008/mcp23s17 and [puredata-ssd1306](https://github.com/konsumer/ssd1306/tree/main/puredata-ssd1306) for SSD1306 OLEDs.
